- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @u-n-s-t-o-p-p-a-b-l-e
- ðŸ‘€ Since I'm having ADHD few years back, finally I turn it into my superpower
- ðŸŒ± My Stacks begin with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Nginx all vanilla's flavor
- ðŸ‘€ Hand's on Python, C, C++, Bash, Assembly (x86-64) and lately Rust
- ðŸ‘€ Hand's on stacks such as React, Vue, MongoDB, Laravel, Javascript PWA
- ðŸ˜„ Yeah those tech stacks will never stop, do they? Also a year in Cyber Security as Ethichal Hacker
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...Jack of all trades (tq ADHD!), master of one (by one). My 3++ years summary will be, 1 year coding, 1 year Cybersec, 1 year procrastinations in between (lol)

- More Neovim kinda guy, but also use emacs(but we will still fighting), Sublime, VSCode, Notepad++ on my Linux
- Tab over spaces (yeah nobody wins so far)
- My virtualizations: VirtualBox, KVM(QEMU), Docker, Kubernetes
- List to be learn: Redis, Clouds, Machine Learning bla..bla..bla... (when will this mental torture finally stops?ðŸ‘€)
- More likely to explore Low-Level Programming, hardware hacking and stuff, OS creation, Own Programming Language etcðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€

- Tips: if you can't handle online abstractions, downloads everything and turn off internet for a week/month or so. Use tool such zeal for offline documentation etc. It works for me ðŸ‘€
